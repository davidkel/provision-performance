        Test an evaluateTransaction() Gateway method against the
        `fixed-asset` Smart Contract method named `emptyContract`, which
        immediately returns a null response. This represents the fastest
        possible round trip time for an evaluateTransaction() method that does
        not touch the world state or perform any action.
        This makes it ideal to determine the theoretical maximum TPS
