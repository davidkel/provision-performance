# Items still to do and need issues for

1. Support a multi-node fabric (ie where the peers/orderers etc have different addresses)
2. automate the deployment of the caliper components using ansible
3. remove the need to have to clone this repo for the scripts to be installed
4. address duplicated files between Automated and BYOF
